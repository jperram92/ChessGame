Wishlist to do

1. Enhance the User Interface
Use a UI Framework: Replace Pygame with a more advanced graphical library like PyQt, Tkinter, or Kivy for a more modern and flexible UI.
Dynamic Resizing: Improve the responsiveness of the UI by dynamically scaling the chessboard and pieces when the window is resized.
Animations: Add smooth animations for piece movements, captures, and transitions between turns.

2. Implement Game Save and Load Functionality
Add the ability to save and load games to/from files (e.g., JSON or PGN format) so users can resume their matches later.
Display a history of moves in standard chess notation, updating in real-time during the game.

3. Add Online Multiplayer Mode
Use a library like Flask-SocketIO or Django Channels to create a server that allows players to compete online.
Implement matchmaking, player profiles, and chat functionality for a richer online experience.

4. Introduce AI Opponent
Integrate a chess engine like Stockfish or write a basic AI using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to allow single-player mode against an AI.
Provide difficulty levels by varying the depth of the AI's search tree.

5. Mobile and Web Compatibility
Convert the project into a web application using frameworks like Flask or Django with a front-end built in React or Vue.js.
Use PWA (Progressive Web App) technologies to make it installable on mobile devices.

6. Enhance Gameplay Features
Game Clock: Add a timer for each player's turn to support timed chess modes like blitz, bullet, or classical.
Undo/Redo Functionality: Allow players to undo or redo moves during casual matches.
Spectator Mode: Enable others to watch games in real-time for hosted games.

7. Improve Rules and Validations
Add support for special moves such as castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
Check for stalemate, threefold repetition, and fifty-move rule to end the game when applicable.
Validate moves against the FIDE chess rules to prevent illegal actions.

8. Host and Deploy
Deploy the game as a web app on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Vercel.
Use a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) to store user profiles, game records, and leaderboards.

9. Add Customization Options
Allow players to customize the chessboard (themes, colors) and pieces (classic, modern, fantasy designs).
Add sound effects for moves, captures, and special events, with an option to toggle sound on/off.

10. Incorporate Analytics and Metrics
Track player performance with detailed stats like win/loss ratio, average move time, and favorite openings.
Integrate analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics for web or custom logging) to monitor usage and identify areas of improvement.
